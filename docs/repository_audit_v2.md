# GradeMIND Repository Technical Audit & Architecture Validation (v2 - Updated)

**Author:** Principal Software Architect  
**Date:** June 13, 2026  
**Project:** GradeMIND Backend & AI Engine

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This updated audit provides a comprehensive reconciliation of the GradeMIND codebase using the latest repository state following a full codebase update from remote. We evaluate the current implementation state, verify the existence of all key authentication and exam models/services, identify migration risks, recalculate readiness scores, and establish the technical path for the upcoming **Submission Module**.

With the latest codebase pulled:
1. **Authentication and Security** are fully database-backed (using PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy), including refresh token rotation, login lockouts, role guards, and audit logs.
2. The **Exam Module** is now fully scaffolded with API endpoints, database CRUD, and tests, though it relies on temporary authentication placeholders in the router.
3. The **AI Pipeline** (OCR wrappers, layout parsing, rubric engine, scoring, and fairness feedback) is highly mature and verified by integration tests.
4. The **Submission Module** remains the primary missing infrastructure component that prevents end-to-end integration.

## 3. Verification of Specific Modules

As requested, we verified the direct existence and status of the following key files:

1. **`user.py`** (`backend/app/models/user.py`): **Exists.** Defines the database model for `User`, containing fields for name, email, role (mapped to `Roles` enum), password hash, and advanced fields for locking account attempts and recording timestamps.
2. **`refresh_token.py`** (`backend/app/models/refresh_token.py`): **Exists.** Defines the database model for `RefreshToken` with `user_id` foreign key, token hash (SHA256 hashed to prevent DB hijacking), IP address, device info, and revocation flags.
3. **`audit_log.py`** (`backend/app/models/audit_log.py`): **Exists.** Defines the database model for tracking security events (`user_id`, `action`, `ip_address`, and `timestamp`).
4. **`auth_service.py`** (`backend/app/services/auth_service.py`): **Exists.** Contains the concrete, database-backed auth logic. Registers users, verifies passwords, updates failed attempts, enforces account lockouts, generates access/refresh tokens, and implements secure refresh token rotation (revoking old tokens and generating new pairs).
5. **`auth_deps.py`** (`backend/app/api/auth_deps.py`): **Exists.** Implements OAuth2 credentials extraction, resolves the current logged-in user, and contains the custom `RoleChecker` decorator guards (`require_admin`, `require_teacher`, `require_teacher_or_admin`).
6. **`exam.py`** (`backend/app/models/exam.py`): **Exists.** Defines the database model for `Exam` (`title`, `subject`, `total_marks`, `status`, and file URLs for question papers/answer keys).
7. **`exams.py`** (`backend/app/api/exams.py`): **Exists.** Integrates REST API routes (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for exam management.
8. **`exam_service.py`** (`backend/app/services/exam_service.py`): **Exists.** Implements core DB helper actions for exams.
9. **`test_exams.py`** (`backend/tests/test_exams.py`): **Exists.** Validates API routing, CRUD integrity, and permissions using an in-memory SQLite DB.

## 4. Recalculated Readiness Scores

Based strictly on the verified files in the current repository state, here are the updated readiness scores:

### Database & Config: 85%
*   **Strengths:** Config handles Groq/Postgres keys correctly. Core engine, sessions, and models are fully registered. 
*   **Weaknesses:** Minor migration risk (duplicate schema creation) needs mitigation.

### Authentication & Authorization: 95%
*   **Strengths:** Database-backed token tracking, rotation, audit logs, and security lockouts are fully implemented. Reusable role guards are defined. Excellent test coverage exists.
*   **Weaknesses:** Integration with the Exam router is pending (router currently uses mock functions).

### Exam Module: 80%
*   **Strengths:** Models, schemas, endpoints, and DB logic exist and are fully tested.
*   **Weaknesses:** Has temporary authentication placeholders instead of using `auth_deps.py`.

### AI OCR & Evaluation Engine: 90%
*   **Strengths:** Full pipelines for image processing, modular OCR engines, manager-level voting, rubric alignment, scoring, feedback generation, and bias evaluation are written and tested.
*   **Weaknesses:** Needs to be wired to a backend event queue (Celery or background tasks) to process actual uploaded submission sheets.

### Submission Module: 0%
*   **Strengths:** Conceptual documentation exists.
*   **Weaknesses:** No models, routes, or services are implemented.

## 5. Branch Convergence & Migration Risks (Critical)

A review of the migration files reveals a **critical conflict** that will cause `alembic upgrade head` to fail on a fresh database:

1. **`134abee8fb3c_create_exams_table.py`** (Base revision) creates the `exams` table.
2. **`9ca611fb35d8_create_users_table.py`** (Revision 2, child of `134abee8fb3c`) attempts to create the `exams` table *again* in its `upgrade()` function, and drop it in its `downgrade()`.
3. Running migrations on a clean database will cause a PostgreSQL crash (`Relation "exams" already exists`) as soon as the second migration runs.

**Remediation Needed:** Modify the `9ca611fb35d8_create_users_table.py` migration script to remove the duplicate `op.create_table('exams', ...)` and `op.drop_table('exams')` calls.

## 6. The True Highest-Priority Missing Module

While the **Submission Module** is the core next step, there are two preliminary modules that must be implemented first as pre-requisites:

1. **First Priority (Refactoring): Clean up placeholders in the Exam Router**
   * Change `backend/app/api/exams.py` to import `get_current_user` and `require_teacher_or_admin` directly from `backend/app/api/auth_deps.py`.
   * Update the `Exam` model to link `teacher_id` via a foreign key relation to the `users` table: `Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=False)`.

2. **Second Priority (New Infrastructure): Storage Service (`storage_service.py`)**
   * A unified storage handler is required to manage exam question papers/answer keys and incoming student submission PDFs (local and S3/Cloud Storage wrappers).
   * This is a blocker because the Submission model needs to store a validated file path (`file_url`).

3. **Third Priority (New Feature): Submission Module**
   * Create `backend/app/models/submission.py` referencing `exam_id` and `student_id`.
   * Implement endpoints for PDF upload, metadata creation, and status checking.
   * Integrate background worker tasks using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` to invoke the `OCRManager` and evaluation scorer once a PDF is received.
